# Dices example code

You will find in this directory two subdirectories with similar names: `risk_1_dice` and `risk_6_dices`. They both implement a solution for the implementation of game **Risk** (ed. Haribo) when rolling dices for armies battles while using package `pltr/dices` of library **PlayTore**.

The `risk_1_dice` solution uses a single dice, rolled as many times as there should be dices rolled.

The `risk_6_dices` solution instantiates and uses as many dices as needed to be rolled (i.e. from 2 to 6 ones).

They slightly differ then and show the use of library **PlayTore** in different ways, using different parts of its code.

Enjoy!
